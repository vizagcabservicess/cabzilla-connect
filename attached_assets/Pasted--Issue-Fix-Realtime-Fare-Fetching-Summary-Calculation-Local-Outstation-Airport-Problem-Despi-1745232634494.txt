‚úÖ Issue: Fix Realtime Fare Fetching & Summary Calculation (Local, Outstation, Airport) Problem Despite calling `/api/direct-local-fares.php`, `/api/direct-outstation-fares.php`, and `/api/direct-airport-fares.php`, my CabList and BookingSummary still show either mock data or outdated `localStorage` values. Fares display wrong or not at all. Console logs show fallback values being stored in localStorage (`fare_local_sedan = 2500`) even when fresh API data is available. Goal Patch the fare fetching + propagation system to eliminate mock data and localStorage usage, correctly displaying real fares in both CabList and BookingSummary. --- üîß Code Fix Required in These Files: `useFare.tsx` - ‚ùå Remove all `localStorage.getItem`, `localStorage.setItem`, and fallbacks. - ‚úÖ Always fetch from real API (`direct-local-fares.php`, `direct-outstation-fares.php`, `direct-airport-fares.php`). - ‚úÖ Normalize `vehicleId` to lowercase + replace non-alphanumeric with `_` to match database (e.g., `Innova Crysta` ‚Üí `innova_crysta`). - ‚úÖ Local: use `data.fares.find(f =f.vehicleId === normalizedId)`. - Use `totalPrice` if available, else fallback to correct package field (`price8hrs80km` etc.). - ‚úÖ Outstation: compute `base_price + distance * price_per_km + driver_allowance`. - ‚úÖ Airport: compute `pickup_price + drop_price` if `total_price` missing. - ‚úÖ Return: `{ basePrice, totalPrice, breakdown }`. `CabList.tsx` - ‚ùå Don't use localStorage to read/store fares. - ‚úÖ After `useFare` call, immediately store the returned `totalPrice` in state. - ‚úÖ Pass that fare directly into `CabOptionCard`. `CabOptionCard.tsx` - ‚úÖ Display the received `fare` using `formatPrice(fare)` when `fare 0`. - ‚úÖ If `fare <= 0`, show ‚ÄúPrice unavailable‚Äù. - ‚ùå Never override a passed-in fare with mock or hardcoded fallback. `BookingSummary.tsx` - ‚úÖ When user selects a cab, call the appropriate fare API via `useFare()` using vehicle, tripType, distance, and package. - ‚úÖ Display each line from the `breakdown` field as Fare Breakdown items. - ‚úÖ Use the `totalPrice` from API as the final total amount. - ‚ùå Never use hardcoded mock totals like `2400`. --- ‚úÖ Additional Requirements - üîÑ Invalidate all stale data on tripType/package/distance change. - üßπ Remove mock price matrices, dummy fare maps, and test values. - ‚úÖ Ensure all components reflect real API fare values, no caching, no zero fallbacks. ---
