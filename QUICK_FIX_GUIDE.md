# 🚀 Quick Fix Guide - Final Issues

## 🎯 **Current Status:**

✅ **Continuous loop stopped** - No more repeated failed requests  
✅ **Backend `get-invoice.php` working** - Returns proper JSON data  
❌ **Frontend still showing "No invoice data returned from the server"**  
❌ **`vizagup.com` still appearing in some places**

## 🔧 **Fix Required:**

### **Step 1: Upload Frontend File**
You need to upload the fixed `AdminBookingsList.tsx` file to your production server:

**File to upload:** `src/components/admin/AdminBookingsList.tsx`

This file has been fixed to:
- Call `get-invoice.php` instead of `generate-invoice.php`
- Use GET request instead of POST
- Handle responses correctly

### **Step 2: Clear Browser Cache**
After uploading the file:
1. **Hard refresh** the browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Clear browser cache** completely
3. **Open in incognito/private mode** to test

### **Step 3: Test the Fix**
After uploading and clearing cache:

1. **Open admin panel**
2. **Click on any booking**
3. **Go to Invoice tab**
4. **Should see invoice data instead of error**

## 📊 **Expected Results:**

### **Before Fix:**
- ❌ "No invoice data returned from the server" error
- ❌ 404 errors in console
- ❌ Continuous failed requests

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ Invoice data displays correctly
- ✅ Single successful API call
- ✅ No error messages
- ✅ Invoice details shown properly

## 🚨 **About `vizagup.com` References:**

The `vizagup.com` references you're seeing are likely:
1. **Server file paths** in error logs (normal - these are server paths, not domain issues)
2. **Old cached content** that will clear after browser cache is cleared
3. **Documentation files** (not affecting the actual application)

## 🎯 **Quick Test:**

After uploading the file and clearing cache, test this URL:
```
https://vizagtaxihub.com/api/admin/get-invoice.php?booking_id=298
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "invoice": {
        "id": 298,
        "booking_number": "VTH2508188F2C5E",
        "passenger_name": "Kumar N",
        "total_amount": "6830.00"
    }
}
```

## ⚠️ **Important:**

The backend is working correctly. The issue is that the **frontend code hasn't been updated** on your production server. Once you upload the `AdminBookingsList.tsx` file and clear the browser cache, everything should work perfectly.
